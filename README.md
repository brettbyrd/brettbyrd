- 👋 Hi, I’m @brettbyrd
- 👀 I’m interested in Flying and creating simple projects to make life easier at work. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code better. I am 100% self taught and I know that there are aspects of my code that would make you all cringe...so go easy on me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... work is best. But not right now.
